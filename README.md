Project:Product Management System.

Description:
A Product Management System in Core Java is a software application designed to efficiently manage product-related operations within a business. It enables users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data, including details such as product ID, name, category, price, and stock quantity. The system may feature search and filter functionalities to quickly locate products based on specific criteria and provide inventory tracking to monitor stock levels and availability. For data storage, the system can utilize file handling, serialization, or database connectivity through JDBC. Built using core Java concepts like object-oriented programming, collections, and exception handling, this system streamlines product lifecycle management, ensuring effective inventory control and supporting smooth business operations.
